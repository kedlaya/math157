Possible changes for next time:
- At the moment, most students come having seen C and/or Java in one of the basic CSE courses. 
  - So maybe we can just formalize this; make them required and build the course around that.
  - Or, make the new DSC10 a formal prerequisite, and shorten the Python unit.
  - Hybrid: require one of CSE5A (C), CSE7 (Matlab), CSE8A (Java), or DSC10 (Python). Corequisite should be fine too.
- More structured version of the week 1 survey. (Use Google Docs to get a spreadsheet.)
  - For programming languages (C/C++, Java, Matlab, Python): ask to choose between
    - never used before
    - seen it used in a class that was primarily about something else (e.g., Matlab in Math 18)
    - had a class primarily based on this
    - familiar with it beyond the level of a class.
- Consider dropping the 20D prerequisite. It was mostly there as a holdover from 152, and also to keep the enrollment under control; but I waived it several times anyway.
  - Alternative: make use of it by adapting the 20D MATLAB material.
- Deploy an instrument to assess learning gains (e.g., SALG). This will require defining more clearly the educational goals of the course.
  - Expose students to some of the conceptual difficulties in translating abstract mathematics into concrete computation.
  - Teach students not just about individual software systems, but also the meta-skill of mastering a new software system from scratch.
  - Provide a pedagogical laboratory for the math department, in which technological innovations can be tested on a small scale before being considered for wider deployment.
- Make a formal list of conceptual topics to be treated.
  - Recursive versus nonrecursive functions
  - Numerical (in)stability in linear algebra
  - Modular exponentiation using repeated squaring
  - Intermediate complexity implosion in linear algebra over Q
- Formalize the meta structure of a typical problem set.
  - First 2 problems are simply testing recall of lecture.
  - Next 2 problems are further exploration of the software.
  - Last 2 problems are exploration of conceptual issues.
  - For later in the course, when the problems get harder, maybe give only 5 problems instead of 6.
- See about getting CoCalc to provide some tools for interactivity in lecture (a la iClicker).
- Introduce pandas in the Python unit, since it is pretty easy and can then be used later for examples and exercises. (Possible downside: its syntax is not consistent with the rest of Python.)
- Fill in more details in the graph theory unit, perhaps expanding it to 3 lectures.
- Find a way for the course grader not to appear as a collaborator on student projects (reported to CoCalc).
- Additional technologies to look into (may not yet be supported by CoCalc):
  - RISE
  - nbgrader
  - tutormagic
- Restructure homework assigments:
  - Given the nature of programming assignments, one per week may be too many. Maybe shift to biweekly assignments due in weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
  - In the off weeks, do some sort of in-class assessment, like a "concept quiz".
- Define the course focus more narrowly.
  - Rename the course to "Python for Mathematics".
  - Edit the course syllabus to focus more specifically on mathematical computation.
  - Specifically exclude data science, statistics, and machine learning, as these are covered in Math 189.
- Consider using Piazza in addition to, or in conjunction with, the chat room.
